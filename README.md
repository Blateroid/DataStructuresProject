# DataStructuresProject

This project was created as my final project for my data structures class. We had to create a program that will have to solve a current problem and implementing all the data structures that we learned in class.

Problem: At the moment, a friend worked at Micro Center and she told me that they had a problem where people would steal from the store by switching the boxes of an unsealed expensive product to a box of a cheaper product and they will just pay for the cheaper product.

Solution: I tought that we could make use of a digital scale that gets connected to the computer and create a check out system that will sort the items that could be swapped and the ones that are completely sealed. Then, it will prompt the cashier everytime he scans (or when he inputs in the case of my program because of a lack of equipment) the barcode of an unsealed product to check it in the weight and the system will automatically give the okay if the weight is the same or alert the cashier if there is something wrong.

I know that some parts of the code could have been done easier by using another data structure, but just to accomplish the requirement of this project I used a different one. 

DataProject1.java is the main class of this project
